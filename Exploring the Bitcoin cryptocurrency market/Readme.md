### Project 3: Exploring the Bitcoin cryptocurrency market
To better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies I explored the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies. Warning: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile, and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. Never invest money you can't afford to lose. To complete this project, I had to be fluent with pandas DataFrames.

Technologies used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
