### Project 5: Dr. Semmelweis and the discovery of handwashing
In 1847 the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

In this python project I reanalyzed the medical data Semmelweis collected. This project assumes that I was familiar with python and pandas DataFrames. 

Technologies used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
