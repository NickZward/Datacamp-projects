# Datacamp projects
This repository contains projects I did on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

### Project 1: Exploring 67 years of Lego
In this project I explored a database of every LEGO set ever built. The Rebrickable database included data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold. It contained data like the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, I got to explore the Rebrickable database. In order to do this I had to know my way around pandas dataframes and matplotlib.

Technologies used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

### Project 2: A New Era of Data Analysis in Baseball
There's a new era of data analysis in baseball. Using a new technology called Statcast, Major League Baseball is now collecting the precise location and movements of its baseballs and players. In this project, I used Statcast data to compare the home runs of two of baseball's brightest (and largest) stars, Aaron Judge (6'7") and Giancarlo Stanton (6'6"), both of whom now play for the New York Yankees.

To complete this project I had to be comfortable with pandas and basic data visualization in Python. The dataset used in this project is from [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/about).

Technologies used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas

### Project 3: Exploring the Bitcoin cryptocurrency market
To better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies I explored the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies. Warning: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile, and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. Never invest money you can't afford to lose. To complete this project, I had to be fluent with pandas DataFrames.

Technologies used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

### Project 4: A Network analysis of Game of Thrones
Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, or Tyrion Lannister? Who is the most important character in Game of Thrones? Let's see what mathematics can tell us about this!

In this project, I looked at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). I looked at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures. In order to complete this project I had to be comfortable with the networkx package and different network centrality measures. I also had to be comfortable with pandas and can manipulate DataFrames. 

This project uses a dataset parsed by Andrew J. Beveridge and Jie Shan which is available [here](https://github.com/mathbeveridge/asoiaf). For more information on this dataset have a look at [the Network of Thrones blog](https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com/).

Technologies used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Networkx
- Jupyter Notebook

### Project 5: Dr. Semmelweis and the discovery of handwashing
In 1847 the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

In this python project I reanalyzed the medical data Semmelweis collected. This project assumes that I was familiar with python and pandas DataFrames. 

Technologies used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
