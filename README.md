# Datacamp projects
This repository contains projects I did on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

### Project 1: Exploring 67 years of Lego
In this project I explored a database of every LEGO set ever built. The Rebrickable database included data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold. It contained data like the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, I got to explore the Rebrickable database. In order to do this I had to know my way around pandas dataframes.
