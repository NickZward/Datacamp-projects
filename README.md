# Datacamp projects
This repository contains projects I did on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

### Project 1: Exploring 67 years of Lego
In this project I explored a database of every LEGO set ever built. The Rebrickable database included data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold. It contained data like the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, I got to explore the Rebrickable database. In order to do this I had to know my way around pandas dataframes and matplotlib.

Technologies used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

### Project 2: A New Era of Data Analysis in Baseball

There's a new era of data analysis in baseball. Using a new technology called Statcast, Major League Baseball is now collecting the precise location and movements of its baseballs and players. In this project, I used Statcast data to compare the home runs of two of baseball's brightest (and largest) stars, Aaron Judge (6'7") and Giancarlo Stanton (6'6"), both of whom now play for the New York Yankees.

To complete this project I had to be comfortable with pandas and basic data visualization in Python. The dataset used in this project is from Baseball Savant(https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/about).
