# Datacamp projects
This repository contains projects I did on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

### Project 1: Exploring 67 years of Lego
In this project I explored a database of every LEGO set ever built. The Rebrickable database included data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold. It contained data like the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, I got to explore the Rebrickable database. In order to do this I had to know my way around pandas dataframes and matplotlib.

Technologies used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

### Project 2: A New Era of Data Analysis in Baseball
There's a new era of data analysis in baseball. Using a new technology called Statcast, Major League Baseball is now collecting the precise location and movements of its baseballs and players. In this project, I used Statcast data to compare the home runs of two of baseball's brightest (and largest) stars, Aaron Judge (6'7") and Giancarlo Stanton (6'6"), both of whom now play for the New York Yankees.

To complete this project I had to be comfortable with pandas and basic data visualization in Python. The dataset used in this project is from [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/about).

Technologies used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas

### Project 3: Exploring the Bitcoin cryptocurrency market

To better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies I explored the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies. Warning: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile, and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. Never invest money you can't afford to lose. To complete this project, I had to be fluent with pandas DataFrames.

Technologies used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
